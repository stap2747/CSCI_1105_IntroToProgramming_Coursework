# Java Blackjack Game

## Synopsis
This is a simple game of blackjack played between 1 player and a dealer which is the computer.

## Motivation
I wanted to try implementing the tools I had been learning while studying Java. A blackjack game is a good way to do so requiring arrays, loops, and other tools.

## How to Run
No files are needed to run this other than the java code. Just initiate the code, and follow the prompts.

## Code Example
```
System.out.print("Would you like to draw another card? Type Y for Yes or N for No: ");
		char answer = input.next().charAt(0);
		answer = Character.toUpperCase(answer);
